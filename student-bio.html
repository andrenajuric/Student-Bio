    <p>I am a UW alumna, class of 2018. I started off as a bio major and hated it. I tried to switch to computer science, but after I didn't do so well in the introduction class, I gave up and never picked it back up again. I am currently a customer service rep. at a construction company and I am here mainly looking for a career change, but also to just explore a past passion again and give it another real try. <a href="#">A link!</a></p>
